# MiniLD66_RTS
A game I was working on for the MiniLD #66 in March of 2016 the game never got off the ground as I realized that my one limitation was that I was bad with AI so I needed to learn pathfinding, studying pathfinding alone took the whole week of the project, so it was abandoned. 

Graphics were either mine, or CC0 ones I found on OpenGameArt. I forgot to keep a list of credits, but all of them were CC0 and this is why(I now keep lists of sources with all my projects, I had planned to do so with this but got sidetracked... Credits.cs was supposed to be one big comment that had all my sources)
